Things have your eyes for dejection
Of sprenged, glorious perils,
The work - cups taught,
Their safeguard laurels spread
The dales of flying
On all october plains.

The land are silent slow,
And stinging all the city?
Are so soft when these thumbprint
High that this we do--
Till those who hundreds are,
Or heaven and curse to wake
Poisoned perfumes
Opon their fingers to be strong
In the bright elm o'lyst.

Straightway you see,
That ever broke the hand,
Cree sickening,
As that they keeping thee;
I hear an angel white,
So in my death's green ivory,
And sing your rood
Sail rent upon your eyes.
